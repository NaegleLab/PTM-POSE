        "\n# Inspecting number of PTMs with annotation information available\n\nAs described in Running PTM-POSE section, PTM-POSE provides various options for annotating functional information for PTMs, coming from various databases. However, PTM functional information is inherently sparse, and so most annotations will only provide information on a handful of PTMs. For this reason, it can be useful to probe how many PTMsTo better understand the types of annotations that are available, as well as the number of PTMs that have an annotation of that type. This can be done using the `analyze` function in PTM-POSE.\n\nNote: This examples assumes that you have already run the PTM-POSE pipeline and have at annotated PTMs with at least one layer of information.\n"
