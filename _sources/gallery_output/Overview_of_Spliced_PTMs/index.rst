    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="One of the first things you will want to do when analyzing spliced PTMs is to check how many and what type of PTMs were identified as being differentially included or altered due to splicing events. This can be done easily using the plotting module in PTM-POSE.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="As described in Running PTM-POSE section, PTM-POSE provides various options for annotating functional information for PTMs, coming from various databases. However, PTM functional information is inherently sparse, and so most annotations will only provide information on a handful of PTMs. For this reason, it can be useful to probe how many PTMsTo better understand the types of annotations that are available, as well as the number of PTMs that have an annotation of that type. This can be done using the analyze function in PTM-POSE.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="In some cases, you may wish to filter out PTMs with weaker evidence (only identified in small number of experiments), splice events with small changes, or PTMs that have not previously been observed to be impacted by splicing. This can be done using the filter_ptms function in the helpers module. We can also visualize the impact of filtering using the analyze.filter module. ">
