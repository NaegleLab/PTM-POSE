        "\n# Probing where and how PTM flanking sequences are altered\n\nIn order to understand how PTMs may be altered due to splicing events, it is useful to identify the flanking sequences of the PTMs and how they may be altered due to nearby splice events (as identified by flanking sequence module). Once we have, this information we can analyze and visualize where the alterations in the flanking sequences occur. First, we need to compare the flanking sequences of PTMs based on whether an exonic region is included or excluded using the `compare_flanking_sequences` function in PTM-POSE.\n"
