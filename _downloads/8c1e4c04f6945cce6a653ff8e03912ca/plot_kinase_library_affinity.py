Kinase affinity due to PTM flanking sequence alterations
============================================================================

Kinases are known to recognize specific motifs surrounding Y, S, and T residues, and these motifs can be used to predict kinase interactions using a tool called Kinase Library. Here, we will use Kinase Library to identify kinases who may have a stronger preference for the flanking sequences of PTMs in one isoform vs. another.

.. note::
    The optional dependency `kinase-library` is required to run this example. You can install it using `pip install kinase-library`.
