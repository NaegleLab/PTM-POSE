This can be done using the `filter_ptms` function in the `helpers` module. We can also visualize the impact of filtering using the `analyze.filter` module. \n"

By default, the filter ptms will also remove any insignificant splice events with a dPSI value less than 0.1 (min_dpsi = 0.1, alpha = 0.05), but let's restrict that a little more to focus on events with changes of at least 20%.\n\n"
