Overview
=============

PTM-POSE is an easily implementable tool to project PTM sites onto splice event data generated from RNA sequencing data and is compatible with any splice event quantification tool that outputs genomic coordinates of different splice events (MATS, SpliceSeq, etc.). PTM-POSE harnesses PTMs that have been mapped to their genomic location by a sister package, ExonPTMapper. It also contains functions for annotating these PTMs with information from various databases, like PhosphoSitePlus and ELM.


For more details about PTM projection and how it can be used to understand the impacts of splicing on cell signaling and other processes, see our pre-print: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.10.575062v2
